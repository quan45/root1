	<p>The Runaways frantically search for their captured friends. The kids go head to head with an unstoppable enemy who has targeted Leslie — or more accurately, the child she’s carrying. Nico Minoru draws them all into a dark realm where its ruler Morgan le Fay is much more nefarious than anyone the kids have yet to face.</p>
	<h4>Marvel Rising: Secret Warriors</h4>
	<img src="resources/rising.jpg" alt="ironman" style="width:200px;height:200px;" class="center">
	<p>In Marvel’s Iron Man VR the player, who plays as the genius inventor Tony Stark, confronts ghosts from his past—powerful forces who seek to ruin him and everything he stands for. By fully embracing the magic of PlayStation VR, players will come face-to-face with iconic allies and Super Villains as they jet around the globe on a heroic mission to save not only Stark Industries, but the world itself.</p>
